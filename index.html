		<p> Kate Morano is a masters student at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY specializing in local accountability and data reporting. She currently works as a staff writer for United University Professions, the union representing SUNY academics, and her work has appeared in the Oneonta Daily Star, WNY Labor Today, and the Albany Student Press. She has written about the impact of local healthcare providers in communities of color, higher education policy and the expansion of financial aid, and conservation efforts in New York's state parks and preserves. Katie is a native of Upstate New York; she enjoys kayaking, a good book, the New York Rangers, and her dogs, Simba and Lola. She hopes to use her writing and research skills to create engaging stories which expose inequities in everyday life and hold those in power accountable.</p>
